# TypeCheckEval-PPLanguage
One of the greatest thing that I have created.  My lecturers have invented the arithmetic logic programming language called as PP. We had to create parser, type check and eval which let you play with that language.

If you want to know something more about language go to prac4, prac5, prac6 pdf files (polish) where You can find some informations. 

HOW DID I DEVELOP THAT LANGUAGE?
